Aqui, vou inserir como tratei as queries para que fosse possível analisar as colunas com o tempo 
Preferi usar o SAFE_CAST pois ele evita que não gera erro ao tentar converter dados inválidos.

-- Criação da Tabela Trusted: trusted_transactions
CREATE OR REPLACE TABLE `teste-lcgbr-leticia.trusted_testelcgbrleticia.trusted_transactions` AS
SELECT
  SAFE_CAST(account_id AS INT64) AS account_id,
  SAFE_CAST(transaction_id AS INT64) AS transaction_id,

  SAFE_CAST(transaction_completed_at AS DATETIME) AS transaction_completed_at
FROM
  `teste-lcgbr-leticia.testelcgbrleticia.transactions`
WHERE
  SAFE_CAST(transaction_amount AS FLOAT64) IS NOT NULL
  AND SAFE_CAST(account_balance AS FLOAT64) IS NOT NULL;

-- Criação da Tabela Trusted: trusted_clients
CREATE OR REPLACE TABLE `teste-lcgbr-leticia.trusted_testelcgbrleticia.trusted_clients` AS
